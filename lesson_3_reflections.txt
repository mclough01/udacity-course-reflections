When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to do that so that other people can see what you are doing and for file sharing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if someone else works on the project and changes something then what they did will automatically overwrite anything you did.
