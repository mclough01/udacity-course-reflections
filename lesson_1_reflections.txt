How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it puts the differences right in front of me so I can easily see where the error might be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
So you can find where something was changed when something wierd happens.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Well I think that was pretty well explained in the lesson, if it saves automatically then you don't even know if it will compile.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If you know that you can try something without breaking everything then it just feels safer.
